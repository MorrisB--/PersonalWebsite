To Do:

/* Hello Div */

* Create Photoshop picture for main image, or find temp image
  * Consider new logo


/* Skills Div */

* Consider adding progress bars to show main languages


/* Projects Div */

* Give title above paragraph
* Make images link to something
* Make images do something onHover()
  * Fade to color and drop in text
* Determine dimensions for images


/* Contact Div */

1) Find Submit button image
2) Change PHP so it doesn't print at the top of the page


Not too important stuff:

* Change rentalsDatabase.PNG to rentalsDatabase.png
* Consider a way to import PHP into index.php, so that can be changed back to index.html
* Consider using a lighter grey
