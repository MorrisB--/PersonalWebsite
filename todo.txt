To Do:


/* Skills Div */

* Adjust hexagons to have padding-left at a percentage so it will look nicer on smaller resolutions


/* Projects Div */

* Add description for images when hovering over them




Not too important stuff:

* Find a way to import PHP into index.php, so that can be changed back to index.html
