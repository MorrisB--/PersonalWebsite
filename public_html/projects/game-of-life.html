				<b>My implementation of Conway's Game of Life. The rules are as
					follows:</b><br> <br>1) Any live cell with fewer than two
				live neighbors dies, as if caused by under-population.<br> <br>2)
				Any live cell with two or three live neighbors lives on to the next
				generation. <br> <br>3) Any live cell with more than three
				live neighbors dies, as if by over-population. <br> <br>4)
				Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbors becomes a live
				cell, as if by reproduction.<br><br><br><br><a href="../index.php"><b>Back to Website</b></a>
